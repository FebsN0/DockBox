The current directory contains folders generated with extract_dbx_best_poses related to the best strategies evidenced in our study. For the sake of space availability, we did not provide folders for all the strategies.

The current directory also contains the script compute_hit_rates.py which provides the hit-rate (top 100) and Enrichment Factor (EF) for every strategy.

The compute_hit_rates.py script requires each folder to include a file called best_poses.csv (normally generated with extract_dbx_best_poses).

The first molecules listed in each best_poses.csv should correspond to active compounds followed by decoys. When running compute_hit_rates.py, simply specify the
number of active molecules in the set.

Here each */best_poses.csv file includes 103 actives followed by 5850 decoys. Therefore, compute_hit_rates.py can be directly executed with the command:

    python compute_hit_rates.py -n 103

Running the above command will generate a directory called top_hits containing the top 100 deduced from each strategy. It will also contain a file called ranking.csv where different strategies are ranked according to their hit rates (where EFs are also provided).
