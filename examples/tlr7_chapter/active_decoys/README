The current directory includes the input files to run rundbx on target #12 and one TLR7 active compound. The config.ini file is the same as the one originally used in our study.

The rundbx command can be simply executed using:

    rundbx -f config.ini -l ligand.mol2 -r target12.pdb

* The analysis folder contains results for all the active molecules (103) and decoys (5850). It shows the performance of different docking, rescoring and 
consensus strategies in terms of hit-rates and Enrichment Factors (EF).

* The mol2files folder contains MOL2 file including all the active molecules and decoys (note that rundbx does not work with MOL2 or PDB files containing
multiple structures, thus, in order to be used with rundbx, MOL2 files inside that folder should be first split in multiple files containing one molecule
each)
